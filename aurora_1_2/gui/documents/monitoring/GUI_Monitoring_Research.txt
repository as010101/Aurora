Commnication:

JNI-
    Any application containing native methods is platform dependent and not
    Write Once Run Anywhere(TM). This is true regardless of whether NMI or JNI
    is used. Applets cannot be affected by a change in native method support.

    http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds4-2/jni.html (useful info on how to use
    JNI... makes it seem like we could be done fairly easily once i understand
    JNI)

SleepyCat-
    Easy java interface... looks like a standard database.
    already have code, accessible from remote machines

--------------

Display:
Graphics2D- need to "setPaint" and pass in a java.awt.Color (r,g,b) (either
using floats from 0.0-1.0 or ints from 0-255)

Do so before the draw call in GenericArc to draw the arc_path

May have to turn the color setup method back on... check that

Refresh- **
 Workspace
 |-Editor
   |-Model
     |-SuperBox
       |-SuperBoxNode (is a model)
       |-parentModel (who opened it... null for first one)
 Workspace as a "update" method which looks like it will redraw

 Plan-
    1) Get all colors of inputs/outputs from database
    2) Scan through all Arcs and setColor(java.awt.Color) on them
    3) Start with Root Editor
    4) DFS scan through, telling all isVisible Editors to update

Workflow Generator:
-need dialog to set levels **
-need to write out to database

current project- 

*understanding database info
*writing to database (workflow)
*reading from database (monitoring)
*dialog to set workflow levels
