> This is your facilities czar speaking.

> We are switching machines. Switching is a five step process.
> If you are not around, you just need to look at steps (a) and (d).
> 
> a) Add /bin/linux and /usr/X11R6/bin to your path.
>    cp .xinitrc to .xsession.
> 
> b) Find a linux box and make sure you can login on the console. 
>    You can get access to the tux lab on the second floor, by seeing Kathy 
>    Kirman (572). The tux lab has 10 linux boxes.
> 
> c) Go to Dorinda Multon's office (571), and choose a slot for your SUN to
>    swapped for a linux box, by writing your login clearly on the chart
>    on her door. Slots will be between now and the end of 
>    the month, between 9 and 10 in the morning. You don't need to be there,
>    but you need to be logged out.
> 
> d) Send Dorinda (djm) an email with your office number, the slot you chose,
>    the name of your SUN, and a name for new machine (you can keep your SUN's
>    name if you want). If you are not around, you don't need a slot. 
>    Include the other three bits. 
> 
> e) Recompile everything on your new, sparkling, fast machine, and enjoy.
>    If there is a program you are missing, check that there exists a debian
>    package for it (go to http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages, and look
>    for packages in the "testing" distribution). If there is, 
>    send email to "problem" mentioning your machine's name and the package 
>    name.  If there isn't, you need to build it yourself. Add the name of the 
>    project and the directory you put it in in /pro/tmp/projects.
> 
> f) If there is something you still need a SUN for, the following SUNs are
>    staying:
>                      angell
>                      bosch
>                      bruford
>                      eggplant
>                      flanger
>                      gano
>                      karla
>                      lippitt
>                      loki
>                      mandolin
>                      markov
>                      poplar
>                      saruman
> 
> That's all! Enjoy!
