Making a LaTeX file:
    The best method is to simply copy a previous LaTeX file rather than to start
    one from scratch. See the README_LATEX.tex for an example.

    With this, you will be all set to insert your own formatted text.

Special tags:
    In the README_LATEX.tex file, there are several tags of note:

    \newcommand: This is the subtitle of the header across each page
    \def\@oddhead: This is what appears across the top of the page

    \section*{}: Section titles

    \begin{enumerate}: Start of a numbered list
    \end{enumerate}: End of a numbered list
    \begin{itemize}: Start of an unnumbered list
    \end{itemize}: End of an unnumbered list

    \item: A list item for either list

Normal text:
    Simple type the text in. If you want to start a new paragraph, use two
    returns to make it clear to a reader of the tex file that you have started a
    new paragraph. LaTeX automatically formats for you.

Generating a *.ps file:
   You need to convert the *.tex file to a *.dvi file, and from the *.dvi file
   to a *.ps file. And you don't want too many intermediary files hanging around
   afterwards, so we use the -c option. The -o "" option is to make sure we
   output to a file rather than print.
   Use: 
   (1) texi2dvi4a2ps -c [filename].tex
   (2) dvips -o "" [filename].dvi

   This can also be achieved by writing:
   texi2dvi4a2ps -c [filename].tex ; dvips -o "" [filename].dvi

   As this is quite annoying to type, I have written a quick script:
   /u/arsinger/bin/tex2ps
   which takes just the first part of the name (not the .tex part) as a
   variable. Also, it should be able to handle multiple files at a time.

   So if you want to PSify:
   my_tex_file.tex another_tex.tex joe.tex
   you would use:
   /u/arsinger/bin/tex2ps my_tex_file another_tex joe
   and should get:
   my_tex_file.ps another_tex.ps joe.ps
   with the original files still there, no intermediary files, and only
   my own personal signature output. All the rest of the junk should be gone.
   Go me!

    While I certainly don't know everything about LaTeX, I'm learning and may be
    able to help out.
