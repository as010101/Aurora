Using ant under solaris
=================================================================
Ant is equivalent to a make, except that it does not require 
explicitly naming each file, and it only requires one "Makefile" 
called build.xml. 

Please refer to http://jakarta.apache.org/ant for details.


1. Set your path to:

     /pro/aurora/tools/solaris/ant/bin:$PATH

2. Set your classpath to:

     /pro/aurora/tools/solaris/java/src.zip:/pro/aurora/tools/solaris/ant/lib/ant.jar:$CLASSPATH

In the aurora directory, there should be a file called build.xml.  To
obtain a list of commands, type

     ant -projecthelp

at the command line and all of the targets should be described.  
To run the gui, type:
  
     ant run

as described under the -projecthelp flags.  Note that targets that 
are dependant on other targets will automatically run the targets 
that they are dependant on.  For example, if the classes are not 
up-to-date, 'ant run' will automatically run 'ant build' first.

Calling 'ant' from this directory will compile all of the java
source files recursively.

================================================================
Using jikes under solaris
================================================================
Jikes is a java compilation tool that runs many, many times faster
than javac.  

1. To set up Jikes for ant, set your path to:

     /pro/aurora/tools/solaris/jikes/src/:$PATH

2. And copy the build.properties.sample file into build.properties:

    cp build.properties.sample build.properties

================================================================
linux usage notes
================================================================
All of the tools that we use default to the solaris configuration.
To use linux, follow the above steps, and then make the following 
changes need to be made:

1. (for ant) set the JAVA_HOME to:

     /pro/aurora/tools/linux/java

2. (for jikes) instead of setting your path to 
/pro/aurora/tools/solaris/jikes/src as stated above, set it to:

     /pro/aurora/tools/linux/jikes/src:$PATH
  
3. If you haven't done so already, copy the build.properties.sample
file into build.properties just like above.

4. Comment out the lines under 
	## values for solaris 
and comment in the lines under 
	## values for linux
