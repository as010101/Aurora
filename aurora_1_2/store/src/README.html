<h1>
Building and Using IOLIB</h1>
Christian Convey, <a href="mailto:cjc@cs.brown.edu,">cjc@cs.brown.edu,</a>
Sept. 3, 2002.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Building IOLIB</h2>
I&nbsp; haven't done much with Makefiles before, so my approaches may be
pretty unorthodox. If something looks done strangely to you, don't immediately
assume I had a good reason for doing it in a non-standard way.
<ol>
<li>
Untar the source code. The top-level directory produced by the tarfile
is "sm/". We'll refer to the parent directory of "sm/" as <i>tar-directory</i>.</li>

<li>
Edit the file <i>tar-directory</i>/sm/src/makedefs.mk, as follows:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Modify the PROJBASE variable to = <i>tar-directory</i>/sm/src</li>

<li>
Modify the TARGETBASE variable to = <i>tar-directory</i>/sm</li>
</ul>

<li>
cd to <i>tar-directory</i>/sm/src</li>

<li>
run make</li>
</ol>
If all goes well, you should see the directory <i>tar-directory</i>/bin/
populated with <i>valid</i> symbolic links to a set of test/benchmark programs.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Tools versions</h3>
I've only tried building this in my local environment, which has the following
relevant versions:
<ul>
<li>
Intel Celeron A 300MHz processor</li>

<li>
Mandrake Linux 8.0, with kernel version 2.4.8-26mdk</li>

<li>
g++ 3.1.1</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Packages</h2>
I did choose to break the code into "packages", to keep the complexity
of code from getting overwhelming. The packages are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
<b>common</b> The "common" package has all of the code that I figured wasn't
Storage Manager specific. I pulled such code into a separate package mostly
to keep myself from being overwhelmed by having too much code to consider
at one time.</li>

<li>
<b>iolib</b> This has the code for interfacing with the file system. If
you look at the code strucutre diagram that I handed out in August 2002,
this covers everything from the bottom of the diagram up through the AsynchPageDir
class.</li>

<li>
<b>sm</b> This is where I figured I'd put the remainder of the Storage
Manager's code. However, since I never got to implement it, this package
is empty.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Directory Structure</h2>
Like I said earlier - I may have done some things oddly out of ignorance.
There's nothing sacred about how I approached this.
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<b>sm/bin/</b> This is where the programs exported by the Storage Manager
code belong. This includes not only whatever interesting utilities we might
dream up, but also unit tests and benchmark programs for the various internal
components of hte Storage Manager.</li>

<li>
<b>sm/include/</b> This is where we give the header files for all the code
that the Storage Manager shares with the outside world. This includes the
helper classes / functions that aren't specific to the Storage Manager,
which which I still thought other parts of the Aurora system might like
to use. There should probably be one .H file here for each .o file that
appears in the directory <i>sm/obj/</i>.</li>

<li>
<b>sm/lib/</b> This is where I intended the library containing the Storage
Manager's code to appear. It's currently empty because I never worked out
how I wanted to produce the library(ies).</li>

<li>
<b>sm/obj/</b> This directory can probably go away if you ever produce
a library containing the Storage Manager's code. This contains all of the
.o files from all of the packages in the Storage Manager. If you have the
Storage Manager ship as a library, no one would need the .o files that
appear in this directory.</li>

<li>
<b>sm/src/</b> The root of the directory tree containing all of the source
code and header files for the Storage Manager.</li>

<li>
<b>sm/src/common/cpp/</b> .C / Makefile files for the "common" package.</li>

<li>
<b>sm/src/common/include/</b> Header files for the "common" package that
are needed by those trying to use the "common" package's exposed functionality.</li>

<li>
<b>sm/src/common/int_include/</b> Header files for the "common" package
that are purely for internal use, and aren't needed by those trying to
use the package's exposed functionality.</li>

<li>
<b>sm/src/iolib/cpp/ </b>.C / Makefile files for the "iolib" package.</li>

<li>
<b>sm/src/iolib/include/ </b>Header files for the "iolib" package that
are needed by those trying to use the "iolib" package's exposed functionality.</li>

<li>
<b>sm/src/iolib/int_include/ </b>Header files for the "iolib" package that
are purely for internal use, and aren't needed by those trying to use the
package's exposed functionality.</li>

<li>
<b>sm/src/sm/...</b> The directory tree that was to contain all of the
code for the remained of the Storage Manager implementation. You can ignore
the content of this directory and structure it however you want.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
The API</h2>
There are two useful interfaces into the IOLIB, depending on whether or
not you want to deal with an asynchronous interface.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
PageDir</h3>
If you want just a simple synchronous interface where you have to be cautious
about what kinds of concurrency you cause, use the class t<i>ar-directory</i>/sm/src/iolib/int_include/PageDir.H.
The file is in the <i>int_include</i> directory because I don't presently
consider it to be part of the exposed API from the <i>iolib</i> package.
However, to make it exposed, here are the steps:
<ol>
<li>
Move it from the <i>tar-directory</i>/sm/src/iolib/int_include/ directory
to the <i>tar-directory</i>/sm/src/iolib/include/ directory.</li>

<li>
Modify all of the #include commands in the project's .H / .C files that
expect the file to be in its old directory, to instead get it in the new
directory.</li>

<li>
Add a symbolic link to the file, in the directory <i>tar-directory</i>/sm/include/.</li>
</ol>
To see how to use the PageDir class, read its .H file and examine the source
code of its unit test program.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
AsynchPageDir</h3>
This class adds several bits of functionality on top of PageDir, which
I thought would be well suited to supporting the buffer cache:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Queued commands.</b> This would let there be just one thread in the
buffer cache, and it could alternate between formulating/enqueueing new
I/O commands and deqeueuing/processing completed I/O commands.</li>

<li>
<b>Automatic file growth.</b> If the page files used by the PageDir are
getting pretty close to full, it's a good bet they'll need to grow soon.
Since growing a page file doesn't necessarily conflict with performing
read/wite operations on that file, it's good to predictively kick off a
growth operation before the space is needed.</li>
</ul>
Of course, since I never implemented the pieces of software that would
actually use the AsynchPageDir, it remains unproven that the AsynchPageDir's
complexity is even needed. Perhaps the PageDir class is all that the rest
of the Storage&nbsp;Manager needs for its disk I/O.
<p>To see how to use the AsynchPageDir class, read its .H file and examine
the source code of its unit test / benchmark programs.
