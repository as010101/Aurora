To run this MITRE demo (the 3 queries, shown around june 26) you need to:

1) copy over this StreamThread.C into ../sched/src (it contains the "workload generator")
2) Run from AURORA_SRC_DIR/bin:
./run_a_network ../auroralib/src/run_a_network/config.xml ../demos/mitre-june-26/

 and run the MITRE network.


THE DEMO:

 3 Mitre Queries. The output queues show:
  "X soldiers crossed the border"
  "center of mass moved by X"
  "tank's turret is close and pointed to friendly unit"
