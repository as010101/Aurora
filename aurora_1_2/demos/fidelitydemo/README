README ON HOW TO RUN THIS THING, based on email sent to Don...

Contact: eddie@cs.brandeis.edu

1,2) [obsolete instructions]
3) untar in some random empty directory, fidelity-demo-tarball.tar.gz, a
self contained tarball of all demo files
4) edit both .xml files for the catalog directory to be correct (points
to FIDNETWORKMOD)
4) ./run or ./run-fidvisual (latter has that alarm monitor, must be run
with config-qmon.xml
  -- if running queuemon, HIT THE START BUTTON
5) ./controller s.cng
6) ./wlgen localhost 40000
     then type "b s", enter. If using queuemon, you should see queues
0,1,2,3 have input.
7) output queues to look at: 13,24,26,29. 13 = "alarms for reuters", 24
for nyse, 26 for nasdaq, 29 for comstock
8) in controller:
   "daf R" to damage reuters, "daf C" for comstock. Then you give a drop
percentage, like "cap 0.8" means 80% drop from that feed. Observe
output. (daf R, cap 0.8, eventually queues 13 gets alarms, and for every
alarm in 13, you get one in either 24 or 26 obviously. No output on 29).
Or use the visualizer to see little flashing yellow/red alarms.


NOTE: the "runner" directory used to be able to generate "./run" but I suggest you ignore that 
unless you HAVE TO. There's also runner2 and workload, that may interest you.
